      As a result of being able to work templates with jade and styles with stylus, we got the urge to create a real time compilator.

      Naranju achieves the task and also creates a custom made environment to implement it.

      Bottom line, this is a MVC emulator without a controller.

      This allows data simulation, its integration to templates, and later on, the inclusion of views and styles to any kind of project.

      This is also a generator of stats sites since, as it compiles and shows in real time, it creates html and CSS files that can understand any server such as Apache, Nginx and Microsoft IIS.
